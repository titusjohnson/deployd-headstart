            Edit app.js and add the desired routes. Name the view model something simple.
            <blockquote><pre>
                App.Routes = {
                    "": "Home",
                    "docs": "Docs",
                    "docs/:document": "ViewDoc"
                    "route/path": "NewViewModelName"
                };
            </pre></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            In /javascript/viewmodels/ create a new file with this as the content. Replace $$NAME$$ with the name of your View Model, assigned above. This file contains only one function, which will be bound by KnockoutJS when a user navigates to the route you created.
            <blockquote><pre>
                App.ViewModels.$$NAME$$ = function(url_values, state) {
                    var self = this;

                    state.PageTitle("Docs");

                    return self;
                };
            </pre></blockquote>
            
        </li>

        <li>
            Create a new html file in /templates/views/, name it $$controller$$.html. Seed it with the following html, and edit the ID accordingly. This file is nothing but a single, or closly related, set of KnockoutJS templates. The file will be concatenated into one single file by Grunt.
            <blockquote><pre>
                &lt;script type="text/html" id="$controller$"&gt;
                    Template HTML here.
                &lt;/script&gt;
            </pre></blockquote>
